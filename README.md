Biscuit PHP is a small stand-alone collection of classes that work together as a framework to help build small server-side applications with PHP.
It's intended to be minimal with no need for dependencies and comes with the basic tools needed for building a small RESTful api, or web application backend.
See the table below for what is included.

### Demo Application

For a demo application that uses this framework, refer to another repo that serves as a boilerplate to get started using this framework: [Biscuit-APP][demo]
